# Slingshot

With only Vanilla Javascript and 4 hours of time create a ball that can be pulled back (like a slingshot) and experiences projectile motion afterwards.

## Features
- Can create a sling with 0-90 degree trajectory
- Uses kinematics + spring physics to determine paths
- Would suggest using modern browsers + horizontal viewports
- Random color on each attempt 

## Video
TODO

## Future
Would like to use OOP for this to attach different forces like spring + gravity
